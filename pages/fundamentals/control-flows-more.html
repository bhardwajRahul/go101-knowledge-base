Goroutines, Deferred Function Calls and Panic/Recover

<div class="tmd-usual">
This article will introduce goroutines and deferred function calls. Goroutine and deferred function call are two unique features in Go. This article also explains panic and recover mechanism. Not all knowledge relating to these features is covered in this article, more will be introduced in future articles.

Goroutines
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, and some CPU cores support hyper-threading. In other words, modern CPUs can process multiple instruction pipelines simultaneously. To fully use the power of modern CPUs, we need to do concurrent programming in coding our programs.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several computations are executed during overlapping time periods. The following picture depicts two concurrent computing cases. In the picture, A and B represent two separate computations. The second case is also called parallel computing, which is special concurrent computing. In the first case, A and B are only in parallel during a small piece of time.

<div class="tmd-usual">
Concurrent computing may happen in a program, a computer, or a network. In Go 101, we only talk about program-scope concurrent computing. Goroutine is the Go way to create concurrent computations in Go programming.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Goroutines are also often called green threads. Green threads are maintained and scheduled by the language runtime instead of the operating systems. The cost of memory consumption and context switching, of a goroutine is much lesser than an OS thread. So, it is not a problem for a Go program to maintain tens of thousands goroutines at the same time, as long as the system memory is sufficient.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Go doesn't support the creation of system threads in user code. So, using goroutines is the only way to do (program scope) concurrent programming in Go.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Each Go program starts with only one goroutine, we call it the main goroutine. A goroutine can create new goroutines. It is super easy to create a new goroutine in Go, just use the keyword <code class="tmd-code-span">go</code> followed by a function call. The function call will then be executed in a newly created goroutine. The newly created goroutine will exit alongside the exit of the called function.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
All the result values of a goroutine function call (if the called function returns values) must be discarded in the function call statement. The following is an example which creates two new goroutines in the main goroutine. In the example, <code class="tmd-code-span">time.Duration</code> is a custom type defined in the <code class="tmd-code-span">time</code> standard package. Its underlying type is the built-in type <code class="tmd-code-span">int64</code>. Underlying types will be explained in <span class="tmd-broken-link">the next article</span>.

Quite easy. Right? We do concurrent programming now! The above program may have three user-created goroutines running simultaneously at its peak during run time. Let's run it. One possible output result:

When the main goroutine exits, the whole program also exits, even if there are still some other goroutines which have not exited yet.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Unlike previous articles, this program uses the <code class="tmd-code-span">Println</code> function in the <code class="tmd-code-span">log</code> standard package instead of the corresponding function in the <code class="tmd-code-span">fmt</code> standard package. The reason is the print functions in the <code class="tmd-code-span">log</code> standard package are synchronized (the next section will explain what synchronizations are), so the texts printed by the two goroutines will not be messed up in one line (though the chance of the printed texts being messed up by using the print functions in the <code class="tmd-code-span">fmt</code> standard package is very small for this specific program).

<h3 id="synchronization" class="tmd-header-3">
Concurrency Synchronization
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Concurrent computations may share resources, generally memory resource. The following are some circumstances that may occur during concurrent computing:
</div>
<ul class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">
<div class="tmd-usual">
In the same period that one computation is writing data to a memory segment, another computation is reading data from the same memory segment. Then the integrity of the data read by the other computation might be not preserved.

</li>
<li class="tmd-list-item">
<div class="tmd-usual">
In the same period that one computation is writing data to a memory segment, another computation is also writing data to the same memory segment. Then the integrity of the data stored at the memory segment might be not preserved.
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
These circumstances are called data races. One of the duties in concurrent programming is to control resource sharing among concurrent computations, so that data races will never happen. The ways to implement this duty are called concurrency synchronizations, or data synchronizations, which will be introduced one by one in later Go 101 articles.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">

<div class="tmd-usual">
The program shown in the last section is not perfect. The two new goroutines are intended to print ten greetings each. However, the main goroutine will exit in two seconds, so many greetings don't have a chance to get printed. How to let the main goroutine know when the two new goroutines have both finished their tasks? We must use something called concurrency synchronization techniques.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Go supports several <span class="tmd-broken-link">concurrency synchronization techniques</span>. Among them, <span class="tmd-broken-link">the channel technique</span> is the most unique and popularly used one. However, for simplicity, here we will use another technique, the <code class="tmd-code-span">WaitGroup</code> type in the <code class="tmd-code-span">sync</code> standard package, to synchronize the executions between the two new goroutines and the main goroutine.

Goroutine States
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The last example shows that a live goroutine may stay in (and switch between) two states, <span class="tmd-bold">running</span> and <span class="tmd-bold">blocking</span>. In that example, the main goroutine enters the blocking state when the <code class="tmd-code-span">wg.Wait</code> method is called, and enter running state again when the other two goroutines both finish their respective tasks.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The following picture depicts a possible lifecycle of a goroutine.

<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Note, a goroutine is still considered to be 'running' if it is asleep (after calling <code class="tmd-code-span">time.Sleep</code> function) or awaiting the response of a system call or a network connection.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
When a new goroutine is created, it will enter the 'running' state automatically. Goroutines can only exit from running state, and never from blocking state. If, for any reason, a goroutine stays in blocking state forever, then it will never exit. Such cases, except some rare ones, should be avoided in concurrent programming.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
A blocking goroutine can only be unblocked by an operation made in another goroutine. If all goroutines in a Go program are in blocking state, then all of them will stay in blocking state forever. This can be viewed as an overall deadlock. When this happens in a program, the standard Go runtime will try to crash the program.
</div>

<div class="tmd-usual">
The following program will crash, after two seconds:

Goroutine Schedule
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Not all goroutines in running state are being executed at a given time. At any given time, the maximum number of goroutines being executed will not exceed the number of logical CPUs available for the current program. We can call the <span class="tmd-broken-link"><code class="tmd-code-span">runtime.NumCPU</code></span> function to get the number of logical CPUs available for the current program. Each logical CPU can only execute one goroutine at any given time. Go runtime must frequently switch execution contexts between goroutines to let each running goroutine have a chance to execute. This is similar to how operating systems switch execution contexts between OS threads.

The following picture depicts a more detailed possible lifecycle for a goroutine. In the picture, the running state is divided into several more sub-states. A goroutine in the queuing sub-state is waiting to be executed. A goroutine in the executing sub-state may enter the queuing sub-state again when it has been executed for a while (a very small piece of time).

<div class="tmd-usual">
The standard Go runtime adopts the <span class="tmd-broken-link">M-P-G model</span> to do the goroutine schedule job, where <span class="tmd-bold">M</span> represents OS threads, <span class="tmd-bold">P</span> represents logical/virtual processors (not logical CPUs) and <span class="tmd-bold">G</span> represents goroutines. Most schedule work is made by logical processors (<span class="tmd-bold">P</span>s), which act as brokers by attaching goroutines (<span class="tmd-bold">G</span>s) to OS threads (<span class="tmd-bold">M</span>s). Each OS thread can only be attached to at most one goroutine at any given time, and each goroutine can only be attached to at most one OS thread at any given time. A goroutine can only get executed when it is attached to an OS thread. A goroutine which has been executed for a while will try to detach itself from the corresponding OS thread, so that other running goroutines can have a chance to get attached and executed.

Deferred Function Calls

<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
A deferred function call is a function call which follows a <code class="tmd-code-span">defer</code> keyword. The <code class="tmd-code-span">defer</code> keyword and the deferred function call together form a defer statement. Like goroutine function calls, all the results of the function call (if the called function has return results) must be discarded in the function call statement.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
When a defer statement is executed, the deferred function call is not executed immediately. Instead, it is pushed into a defer-call stack maintained by its innermost nesting function call. After a function call <code class="tmd-code-span">fc(...)</code> returns (but has not fully exited yet) and enters its <span class="tmd-broken-link">exiting phase</span>, all the deferred function calls pushed into its defer-call stack will be removed from the defer-call stack and executed, in first-in, last-out order, that is, the reverse of the order in which they were pushed into the defer-call stack. Once all these deferred calls are executed, the function call <code class="tmd-code-span">fc(...)</code> fully exits.

Here, we just need to know that the blank interface type <code class="tmd-code-span">interface{}</code> can be viewed as the <code class="tmd-code-span">any</code> type or the <code class="tmd-code-span">Object</code> type in many other languages. In other words, we can pass a value of any type to a <code class="tmd-code-span">panic</code> function call.

The value returned by a <code class="tmd-code-span">recover</code> function call is the value a <code class="tmd-code-span">panic</code> function call consumed.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The example below shows how to create a panic and how to recover from it.
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("exit normally.")
	}()
	fmt.Println("hi!")
	defer func() {
		v := recover()
		fmt.Println("recovered:", v)
	}()
	panic("bye!")
	fmt.Println("unreachable")
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The output:
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code output">
hi!
recovered: bye!
exit normally.
</pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Here is another example which shows a panicking goroutine exits without being recovered. So the whole program crashes.
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hi!")

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		panic(123)
	}()

	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The output:
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code output">
hi!
panic: 123

goroutine 5 [running]:

<div class="tmd-usual">
Go runtime will create panics for some circumstances, such as dividing an integer by zero. For example,
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	a, b := 1, 0
	_ = a/b
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The output:
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code output">
panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero

goroutine 1 [running]:
...
</pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
More runtime panic circumstances will be mentioned in later Go 101 articles.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Generally, panics are used for logic errors, such as careless human errors. Logic errors should never happen at run time. If they happen, there must be bugs in the code. On the other hand, non-logic errors are hard to absolutely avoid at run time. In other words, non-logic errors are errors happening in reality. Such errors should not cause panics and should be explicitly returned and handled properly.

Some Fatal Errors Are Not Panics and They Are Unrecoverable

<div class="tmd-usual">
For the standard Go compiler, some fatal errors, such as stack overflow and out of memory are not recoverable. Once they occur, program will crash.
