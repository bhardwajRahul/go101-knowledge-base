How to Gracefully Close Channels
</h1>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Several days ago, I wrote an article which explains <span class="tmd-broken-link">the channel rules in Go</span>. That article got many votes on <span class="tmd-broken-link">reddit</span> and <span class="tmd-broken-link">HN</span>, but there are also some criticisms on Go channel design details.

<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
I collected some criticisms on the following designs and rules of Go channels:
</div>
<ol class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">
<div class="tmd-usual">
no easy and universal ways to check whether or not a channel is closed without modifying the status of the channel.

<div class="tmd-usual">

</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The criticisms look reasonable, however in fact are not. Yes, there is really not a built-in function to check whether or not a channel has been closed.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
=== the last article <span class="tmd-smaller-size">channel-use-cases.html#check-closed-status</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
There is indeed a simple method to check whether or not a channel is closed if you can make sure no values were (and will be) ever sent to the channel. The method has been shown in <span class="tmd-broken-link">the last article</span>. Here, for better coherence, the method is listed in the following example again.
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type T int

func IsClosed(ch &lt;-chan T) bool {
	select {
	case &lt;-ch:
		return true
	default:
	}

	return false
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan T)
	fmt.Println(IsClosed(c)) // false
	close(c)
	fmt.Println(IsClosed(c)) // true
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
As above mentioned, this is not a universal way to check whether a channel is closed.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
In fact, even if there is a simple built-in <code class="tmd-code-span">closed</code> function to check whether or not a channel has been closed, its usefulness would be very limited, just like the built-in <code class="tmd-code-span">len</code> function for checking the current number of values stored in the value buffer of a channel. The reason is that the status of the checked channel may have changed just after a call to such functions returns, so that the returned value has already not been able to reflect the latest status of the just checked channel. Although it is okay to stop sending values to a channel <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code> if the call <code class="tmd-code-span">closed(ch)</code> returns <code class="tmd-code-span">true</code>, it is not safe to close the channel or continue sending values to the channel if the call <code class="tmd-code-span">closed(ch)</code> returns <code class="tmd-code-span">false</code>.
</div>
<p></p>
<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
The Channel Closing Principle
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
One general principle of using Go channels is <span class="tmd-bold">don't close a channel from the receiver side and don't close a channel if the channel has multiple concurrent senders</span>. In other words, we should only close a channel in a sender goroutine if the sender is the only sender of the channel.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
<span class="tmd-italic">(Below, we will call the above principle as <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span>.)</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Surely, this is not a universal principle to close channels. The universal principle is <span class="tmd-bold">don't close (or send values to) closed channels</span>. If we can guarantee that no goroutines will close and send values to a non-closed non-nil channel any more, then a goroutine can close the channel safely. However, making such guarantees by a receiver or by one of many senders of a channel usually needs much effort, and often makes code complicated. On the contrary, it is much easy to hold the <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span> mentioned above.
</div>
<p></p>
<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Solutions Which Close Channels Rudely
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
=== the recover mechanism <span class="tmd-smaller-size">control-flows-more.html#panic-recover</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
If you would close a channel from the receiver side or in one of the multiple senders of the channel anyway, then you can use <span class="tmd-broken-link">the recover mechanism</span> to prevent the possible panic from crashing your program. Here is an example (assume the channel element type is <code class="tmd-code-span">T</code>).
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">func SafeClose(ch chan T) (justClosed bool) {
	defer func() {
		if recover() != nil {
			// The return result can be altered
			// in a defer function call.
			justClosed = false
		}
	}()

	// assume ch != nil here.
	close(ch)   // panic if ch is closed
	return true // &lt;=&gt; justClosed = true; return
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
This solution obviously breaks the <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span>.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The same idea can be used for sending values to a potential closed channel.
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">func SafeSend(ch chan T, value T) (closed bool) {
	defer func() {
		if recover() != nil {
			closed = true
		}
	}()

	ch &lt;- value  // panic if ch is closed
	return false // &lt;=&gt; closed = false; return
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Not only does the rude solution break the <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span>, but data races might also happen in the process.
</div>
<p></p>
<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Solutions Which Close Channels Politely
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Many people prefer using <code class="tmd-code-span">sync.Once</code> to close channels:
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">type MyChannel struct {
	C    chan T
	once sync.Once
}

func NewMyChannel() *MyChannel {
	return &amp;MyChannel{C: make(chan T)}
}

func (mc *MyChannel) SafeClose() {
	mc.once.Do(func() {
		close(mc.C)
	})
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Surely, we can also use <code class="tmd-code-span">sync.Mutex</code> to avoid closing a channel multiple times:
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">type MyChannel struct {
	C      chan T
	closed bool
	mutex  sync.Mutex
}

func NewMyChannel() *MyChannel {
	return &amp;MyChannel{C: make(chan T)}
}

func (mc *MyChannel) SafeClose() {
	mc.mutex.Lock()
	defer mc.mutex.Unlock()
	if !mc.closed {
		close(mc.C)
		mc.closed = true
	}
}

func (mc *MyChannel) IsClosed() bool {
	mc.mutex.Lock()
	defer mc.mutex.Unlock()
	return mc.closed
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
These ways may be polite, but they may not avoid data races. Currently, Go specification doesn't guarantee that there are no data races happening when a channel close and a channel send operations are executed concurrently. If a <code class="tmd-code-span">SafeClose</code> function is called concurrently with a channel send operation to the same channel, data races might happen (though such data races generally don't do any harm).
</div>
<p></p>
<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Solutions Which Close Channels Gracefully
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
One drawback of the above <code class="tmd-code-span">SafeSend</code> function is that its calls can't be used as send operations that follow the <code class="tmd-code-span">case</code> keyword in <code class="tmd-code-span">select</code> blocks. The other drawback of the above <code class="tmd-code-span">SafeSend</code> and  <code class="tmd-code-span">SafeClose</code> functions is that many people, including me, would think the above solutions by using <code class="tmd-code-span">panic</code>/<code class="tmd-code-span">recover</code> and <code class="tmd-code-span">sync</code> package are not graceful. Following, some pure-channel solutions without using <code class="tmd-code-span">panic</code>/<code class="tmd-code-span">recover</code> and <code class="tmd-code-span">sync</code> package will be introduced, for all kinds of situations.

<div class="tmd-usual">
As mentioned in the comments, for the additional signal channel, its sender is the receiver of the data channel. The additional signal channel is closed by its only sender, which holds the <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span>.

<div class="tmd-usual">
In this example, the channel <code class="tmd-code-span">dataCh</code> is never closed. Yes, channels don't have to be closed.

<div class="tmd-usual">
There are no situations which will force you to break the <span class="tmd-bold">channel closing principle</span>. If you encounter such a situation, please rethink your design and rewrite you code.
