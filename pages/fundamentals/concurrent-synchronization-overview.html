What Are Concurrency Synchronizations?
</h3>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Concurrency synchronizations means how to control concurrent computations (a.k.a., goroutines in Go)

What Synchronization Techniques Does Go Support?
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
The article <span class="tmd-broken-link">channels in Go</span> has shown that we can use channels to do synchronizations. Besides using channels, Go also supports several other common synchronization techniques, such as mutex and atomic operations. Please read the following articles to get how to do synchronizations with all kinds of techniques in Go:

We can also do synchronizations by making use of network and file IO. But such techniques are very inefficient within a single program process. Generally, they are used for inter-process and distributed synchronizations. Go 101 will not cover such techniques.

<div class="tmd-usual">
To understand these synchronization techniques better, it is recommended to know the <span class="tmd-broken-link">memory order guarantees in Go</span>.

The data synchronization techniques in Go will not prevent programmers from writing <span class="tmd-broken-link">improper concurrent code</span>. However these techniques can help programmers write correct concurrent code easily. And the unique channel related features make concurrent programming flexible and enjoyable.
