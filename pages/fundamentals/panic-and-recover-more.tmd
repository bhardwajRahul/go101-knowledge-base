### Explain Panic/Recover Mechanism in Detail

Panic and recover mechanism has been __introduced before__,
and several panic/recover use cases are shown in __the last article__.
This current article will explain panic/recover mechanism in detail.
Exiting phases of function calls will also be explained in detail.

###+++++++++++ Exiting Phases of Function Calls

In Go, a function call may undergo an exiting phase before it fully exits.
In the exiting phase, the deferred function calls pushed into the defer-call stack
during executing the function call will be executed (in the inverse pushing order).
When all of the deferred calls fully exit,
the exiting phase ends and the function call also fully exits.

Exiting phases might also be called returning phases elsewhere.

A function call may enter its exiting phase (or exit directly) through three ways:
*.
   after the call returns normally.
*.
   when a panic occurs in the call.
*.
   after the `runtime.Goexit` function is called and fully exits in the call.

For example, in the following code snippet,
*
   a call to the function `f0` or `f1`
   will enter its existing phase after it returns normally.
*
   a call to the function `f2` will enter its exiting phase
   after the divided-by-zero panic happens.
*
   a call to the function `f3` will enter its exiting phase
   after the `runtime.Goexit` function call fully exits.

func f2() {
	var x, y = 1, 0
	defer fmt.Println("exits for panicking:", x)
	x = x / y // will panic
	x++       // unreachable
}

func f3() int {
	x := 1
	defer fmt.Println("exits for Goexiting:", x)
	x++
	runtime.Goexit()
	return x+x // unreachable
}

BTW, the `runtime.Goexit()` function is not intended to be called in the main goroutine of a program.

###+++++++++++ Associating Panics and Goexit Signals of Function Calls

When a panic occurs directly in a function call, we say the (unrecovered) panic starts associating with the function call.
Similarly, when the `runtime.Goexit` function is called in a function call,
we say a Goexit signal starts associating with the function call after the `runtime.Goexit` call fully exits.
As explained in the last section,
associating either a panic or a Goexit signal with a function call
will make the function call enter its exiting phase immediately.

We have learned that __panics can be recovered__.
However, there are no ways to cancel a Goexit signal.

    === panics can be recovered :: control-flows-more.html#panic-recover

At any give time, a function call may associate with at most one unrecovered panic.
If a call is associating with an unrecovered panic, then
*
   the call will associate with no panics when the unrecovered panic is recovered.
*
   when a new panic occurs in the function call, the new one will replace
   the old one to become the associating unrecovered panic of the function call.

For example, in the following program, the recovered panic is panic 3,
which is the last panic associating with the `main` function call.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println(recover()) // 3
	}()
	
	defer panic(3) // will replace panic 2
	defer panic(2) // will replace panic 1
	defer panic(1) // will replace panic 0
	panic(0)
}
'''

As Goexit signals can't be cancelled,
arguing whether a function call may associate with at most one or more than one Goexit signal is unnecessary.

Although it is unusual, there might be multiple unrecovered panics coexisting in a goroutine at a time.
Each one associates with one not-exited-yet function call in the call stack of the goroutine.
When a nested call fully exits and it still associates with an unrecovered panic,
the unrecovered panic will spread to the nesting call (the caller of the nested call).
The effect is the same as a panic occurs directly in the nesting call.
That says,
*
   if there was an old unrecovered panic associating with the nesting call before,
   the old one will be replaced by the spread one.
   For this case, the nesting call must had already entered its exiting phase for sure,
   so the next deferred function call in its defer-call stack will be invoked.
*
   if there was not an unrecovered panic associating with the nesting call before,
   the spread one will associates with the nesting call.
   For this case, the nesting call might have entered its exiting phase or not.
   If it hasn't, it will enter its exiting phase immediately.

So, when a goroutine finishes to exit, there may be at most one unrecovered panic in the goroutine.
If a goroutine exits with an unrecovered panic, the whole program crashes,
and the information of the unrecovered panic will be reported.
Otherwise, the goroutine exits normally (peacefully).

When a function is invoked, there is neither a panic nor Goexit signals associating with its call initially,
no matter whether its caller (the nesting call) has entered exiting phase or not.
Surely, panics might occur or the `runtime.Goexit` function might be called later
in the process of executing the call, so panics and Goexit signals might associate with the call later.

The following example program will crash if it runs,
because the panic 2 is still not recovered when the new goroutine exits.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

func main() {
	// The new goroutine.
	go func() {
		// This is an anonymous deferred call.
		// When it fully exits, the panic 2 will spread
		// to the entry function call of the new
		// goroutine, and replace the panic 0. The
		// panic 2 will never be recovered.
		defer func() {
			// As explained in the last example,
			// panic 2 will replace panic 1.
			defer panic(2)
			
			// When the anonymous function call fully
			// exits, panic 1 will spread to (and
			// associate with) the nesting anonymous
			// deferred call.
			func () {
				// Once the panic 1 occurs, there will
				// be two unrecovered panics coexisting
				// in the new goroutine. One (panic 0)
				// associates with the entry function
				// call of the new goroutine, the other
				// (panic 1) associates with the
				// current anonymous function call.
				panic(1)
			}()
		}()
		panic(0)
	}()
	
	select{}
}
'''

The output (when the above program is compiled with the standard Go compiler v1.25.n):
@@@ .output
'''
panic: 0
	panic: 1
	panic: 2

...
'''

The format of the output is not perfect,
it is prone to make some people think that the panic 0 is the final unrecovered panic,
whereas the final unrecovered panic is actually panic 2.

Similarly, when a nested call fully exits and it is associating with a Goexit signal,
then the Goexit signal will also spread to (and associate with) the nesting call.
This will make the nesting call enter (if it hasn't entered) its exiting phase immediately.

When a Goexit signal associates with a function call,
if the function call is associating with an unrecovered panic,
then the panic will be recovered (honestly, it is weird to me).
For example, the following program will exit peacefully,
because the `bye` panic will be recovered by the Goexit signal.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

import (
	"runtime"
)

func f() {
	// The Goexit signal will disable the "bye" panic.
	defer runtime.Goexit()
	panic("bye")
}

func main() {
	go f()
	
	for runtime.NumGoroutine() > 1 {
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
}

{ //
The above has mentioned that a panic and a Goexit signal are independent of each other.
In other words, an unrecovered panic should not cancel a Goexit signal,
and a Goexit signal should not shadow an unrecovered panic or be cancelled.
However, both of the current official standard Go compiler (gc, v1.19) and gccgo (v10)
don't implement this rule correctly.
For example, the following program should crash but it doesn't
if it is compiled with the current versions of gc and gccgo.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

import "runtime"

func f() {
	// The Goexit signal shadows the "bye"
	// panic now, but it should not.
	defer runtime.Goexit()
	panic("bye")
}

func main() {
	go f()
	
	for runtime.NumGoroutine() > 1 {
		runtime.Gosched()
	}

###+++++++++++ Some `recover` Calls Are No-Ops

The builtin `recover` function must be called at proper places to take effect.
Otherwise, the calls are no-ops.
For example, none of the `recover` calls in the following example recover the `bye` panic.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

func main() {
	defer func() {
		defer func() {
			recover() // no-op
		}()
	}()
	defer func() {
		func() {
			recover() // no-op
		}()
	}()
	func() {
		defer func() {
			recover() // no-op
		}()
	}()
	func() {
		defer recover() // no-op
	}()
	func() {
		recover() // no-op
	}()
	recover()       // no-op
	defer recover() // no-op
	panic("bye")
}
'''

We have already known that the following `recover` call takes effect.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
package main

func main() {
	defer func() {
		recover() // take effect
	}()

	panic("bye")
}
'''

Then why don't those `recover` calls in the first example of the current section take effect?
Let's read the current version of __Go specification__:

    === Go specification :: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Handling_panics


>  The return value of `recover` is `nil` if any of the following conditions holds:
   {
   *  `panic`'s argument was nil;
   *  the goroutine is not panicking;
   *  `recover` was not called directly by a deferred function.
   }

There is __an example__ showing the first condition case in the last article.

    === an example :: panic-and-recover-use-cases.html#avoid-verbose

Most of the `recover` calls in the first example of the current section satisfy
either the second or the third conditions mentioned in Go specification,
except the first call. Yes, here, the current descriptions are not precise yet.
The third condition should be described as

*
   `recover` was not called directly by a deferred function **call which was called directly
   by the function call associating with the expected to-be-recovered panic**.

In the first example of the current section, the expected to-be-recovered panic is associating with
the `main` function call. The first `recover` call is called
directly by a deferred function call but the deferred function call is not called directly
by the `main` function call. This is why the first `recover` call is a no-op.

In fact, the current Go specification also doesn't explain well why the second
`recover` call (by code line order), which is expected to recover panic 1,
in the following example doesn't take effect.

@@@ .line-numbers
''' go
// This program exits without recovering panic 1.
package main

func demo() {
	defer func() {
		defer func() {
			recover() // this one recovers panic 2
		}()

		defer recover() // no-op

		panic(2)
	}()
	panic(1)
}

func main() {
	demo()
}
'''

What Go specification doesn't mention is that,
every `recover` call is viewed as an attempt
to recover the newest unrecovered panic in the current goroutine.

Go runtime thinks the second `recover` call in the above example attempts to recover
the newest unrecovered panic, panic 2, which is associating with the caller call
of the second `recover` call. The second `recover` call
is not called directly by a deferred function call which is called by the associating function call.
Instead, it is directly called by the associating function call.
This is why the second `recover` call is a no-op.

@@@ #summary
###+++++++++++ Summary

OK, now, let's try to make a short description on which `recover` calls will take effect:
@@@ .alert;alert-warning
{
A `recover` call takes effect only if the direct caller of
the `recover` call is a deferred call and
the direct caller of the deferred call associates with
the newest unrecovered panic in the current goroutine.
An effective `recover` call disassociates the
newest unrecovered panic from its associating function call,
and returns the value passed to the `panic` call
which produced the newest unrecovered panic.
