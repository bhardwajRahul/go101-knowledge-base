# About Go Generics 101

Since version 1.18, Go has supported custom generics.

This book talks about the custom generics feature of Go programming language.
The content in this book includes:

* custom generic syntax,
* type constraints and type parameters,
* type arguments and type inference,
* how to write valid custom generic code,
* current implementation/design restrictions.

A reader needs to be familiar with Go general programming to read this book.
In particular, readers of this book should be familiar with
[Go type system](https://go101.org/article/type-system-overview.html),
including Go built-in generics, which and Go custom generics are two different systems.

Currently, the book mainly focuses on the syntax of (and concepts in) custom generics.
More practical examples will be provided when I get more experiences of using custom generics.

## About GoTV

During writing this book, the tool [GoTV](https://go101.org/apps-and-libs/gotv.html)
is used to manage installations of multiple Go toolchain versions and check
the behavior differences between Go toolchain versions.

    A defined interface type X can be converted to a defined interface type Y,
    and vice versa, if their underlying types are identical.
    That is the difference between interface types and non-interface types.

* type argument inferences still have some limitations
  * https://github.com/golang/go/issues/63750

* type argument inference needs more detailed explainations.
 

* example: how to define an expected constraint?
  * some achievable, some are not.  

* An example show the difference of using ordinary interface and generic constraint.
